			<h1>Travis Selland</h1>
			<h4>My Hometown</h4>
			<p>I grew up in a town in the San Francisco Bay Area. My grandparents bought a house there in the 50's, which my parents bought from them in the 80's and that is the house my family continues to live in today. Danville is nestled in the golden valleys east of Oakland. The town seeks to maintain the feeling and atmosphere of a small town with few chain stores downtown and many events throughout the year. The 4th of July parade is not to be missed, and the annual Tree Lighting just after Thanksgiving brings the whole town out for the night. Sports are taken seriously there; we have some of the most competitive club and high school teams in the state. It was a great place to grow up and I would love to move back there at some point. </p>
			<h4>My Hobbies</h4>
			<p>I love playing sports, and am grateful to have been able to play so many both competitively and recreationally. I played volleyball and soccer in high school, and in college I have played intramurals including wallyball, intertube waterpolo, ultimate frisbee, kickball,and flag football. I enjoy hiking with my father and my wife. I have climbed Yosemite's Half Dome, Mt. Whitney in central California, and am looking forward to making the trek to the top of Mt. Timpanogos in Utah. I was a part of my high school choir, and I continue to sing, if only in the car. I have also participated in a couple running races and hope to do more. You can read more about my hobbies and adventures in the Adventures section.</p>
			<h4>My Family</h4>
			<p>My wife and I met in our Freshman biology class in high school. We were good friends for a few years before we started dating towards the end of our Junior year. We parted ways for college; she studied psychology and ran on the track team at UC San Diego while I began my studies at Brigham Young University. We continued our relationship at a distance until we were married in May 2013. She is now attending BYU as a graduate student in Marriage and Family Therapy; she is also working towards a minor in Nonprofit Management in the Marriott School of Management.</p>
